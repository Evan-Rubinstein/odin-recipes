            <li>1 lb. spaghetti</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Recipe</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, combine the egg, basil, parsley, oregano, salt, pepper, garlic and water; whisk well</li>
            <li>Add the meat, breadcrumbs, and parmigiano reggiano</li>
            <li>Mix with your hands until just combined</li>
            <li>Roll the mixture into golf ball-sized meatballs, and place on an ungreased baking sheet</li>
            <li>Bake for about 10 minutes, then remove the baking sheet from the oven and use a metal spatula or tongs to turn the meatballs</li>
            <li>Put the meatballs back in the oven and cook for another 10 minutes, until they are nicely browned and almost cooked through</li>
            <li>At the same time, bring the marinara sauce to a simmer in a large skillet. Taste it and adjust the seasoning if necessary. Transfer the browned meatballs to the marinara sauce, leaving the fat behind. Cover loosely with a lid or foil and simmer for about 10 minutes, until the flavors marry and the meatballs are cooked through. Keep warm until ready to toss with pasta.</li>
            <li>While the meatballs are cooking, bring a large pot of well-salted water to a boil</li>
            <li>Add the spaghetti and cook until al dente. Drain, then toss with the sauce and meatballs</li>
            <li>Transfer the spaghetti and meatballs to serving bowls and top with fresh chopped basil and more grated cheese.</li>
        </ol>
