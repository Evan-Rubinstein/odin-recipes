        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound extra-lean ground beef</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon garlic-pepper blend</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon onion powder</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 cups frozen sugar snap peas, carrots, onions and mushrooms</li>
            <li>32 frozen steak fries</li>
            <li>4 frozen half-ears corn-on-the-cob</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic-pepper blend</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Recipe</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oven to 450°. Cut four 18x12-inch sheets of aluminum foil.</li>
            <li>Mix beef, Worcestershire sauce, 1 teaspoon garlic-pepper blend, the onion powder and salt. Shape mixture into 4 patties, about 1/4 inch thick. </li>
            <li>Place 1 patty on each foil sheet about 2 inches from 12-inch side. Top each with 1/2 cup vegetables and 8 steak fries. Place 1 piece of corn next to each patty. Divide remaining 1/2 teaspoon garlic-pepper blend among vegetables. Bring up 2 sides of foil so edges meet. Seal edges, making tight 1/2-inch fold; fold again, allowing space for heat circulation and expansion. Fold other sides to seal. Place packets on large cookie sheet</li>
            <li>Bake 35 to 40 minutes or until meat thermometer inserted in center of patties reads 160°F. Place packets on plates. To serve, cut large X across top of each packet; carefully fold back foil. </li>
        </ol>
