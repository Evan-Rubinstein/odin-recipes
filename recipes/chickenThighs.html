        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>A quick and easy recipe to make chicken thighs in an air frier</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 skin-on, boneless chicken thighs</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
            <li>3/4 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Recipe</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat an air fryer to 400 degrees farenheit</li>
            <li>Pat chicken thighs dry with a paper towel and brush skins with olive oil. Place chicken thighs, skin-side down, in a single layer on a plate.</li>
            <li>Combine smoked paprika, garlic powder, salt, and pepper in a bowl. Sprinkle 1/2 of the seasoning mixture evenly over thighs. Turn thighs over and evenly sprinkle with remaining seasoning. Arrange thighs, skin-side up, in a single layer in the air fryer basket.</li>
            <li>Cook in the preheated air fryer until thighs are brown and the juices run clear, about 18 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees farenheit</li>
        </ol>
